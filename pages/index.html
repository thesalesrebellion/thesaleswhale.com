      <p>I am of the belief that sales has long been one of the greatest professions in the history of the world. Yet between the “adults only” approach of Hollywood’s version of sales and the very selfish-misconstrued outlook of the popular gurus who teach sales as if it is some kind of war being waged between buyer and seller&hellip; The options are slim to none for teaching your kids.</p>
      <p>Cue The Sales Whale! Now there is a fun way to show the next generation that sales is about service, relationships and the experience we give others. So if you’ve been looking for a way to teach your kids about sales, look no further!</p>

          <p>Sales is all about service. It’s about what we can do for the community we seek to serve. If I sell copiers, I don’t push the product and all of its features on the people I think might want to buy one. Instead I seek to understand their work environment and how my copier helps fix problems they might have to deal with. Or, how my copier can better their existing environment and the gaps they might be experiencing by not knowing what else might be available to them. It’s also very important to give a great experience to those we seek to serve. Creativity in sales is the recipe to unforgettable experiences and earning the trust of the community you’re selling to. In a nutshell, sales is not about your product or service. It’s about the problems you fix, the way you show up, the experience you give and the legacy of servant leadership you’re living out daily.</p>

          <p>Sales has earned a bad reputation over the years because so many professionals have jumped in the fast lane and done “whatever it takes” to achieve instant gratification. Too many put their focus and the purpose of why they’re in our profession on gaining power over their prospect and the commission check they earn from the sale&hellip; This is not the way. Being more vulnerable, empathetic and servant leader minded yields better, long lasting results. Because it challenges you to take risks, embrace discomfort and to be more authentic with everyone you come across. These ingredients create long lasting and trust based relationships with other humans who will in-turn reward you with their loyalty throughout their time knowing you This is the way.</p>
